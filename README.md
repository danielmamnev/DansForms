## Dan's Forms



Dan's Forms is a complete web application using Laravel. You can register, log in, and create forms to send to anyone for submission. You will then be able to view the submissions of the forms you created. You are able to create, edit, and delete your forms whenever you wish.

For example,

if you are a teacher looking to get some feedback from your students on your class - you can create a form and send all of your students the link to fill out the form and they can submit it for your review. 


## Upcoming Features

Currently, we are developing an option to export all of your submissions to a form to a .CSV file for Excel.
